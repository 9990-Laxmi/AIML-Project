City Water Consumption Analysis


This project analyzes a year's worth of simulated city water consumption data to uncover key usage patterns.

Objective: To analyze a year's worth of city water consumption data to identify key demand patterns, such as seasonal trends, weekly cycles, and usage differences across city zones.

What It Does:

1.Creates Data: Generates realistic data with hidden trends (seasonal highs, weekend spikes, and different usage by city zones).

2.Cleans & Prepares: Organizes the data and extracts useful features like month and day_of_week from the date.

3.Analyzes & Visualizes:
Line Plots show daily consumption trends over the year.
Bar Plots clearly compare consumption by month (seasonal patterns), by day of the week (weekly patterns), and by city zone.

4.Generates a Statistics Report: Provides precise numbers (averages, totals, peak demand day) to back up the visual findings.

Key Features:

Pattern Detection: Identifies seasonal, weekly, and geographical demand patterns.

Data Visualization: Uses the right type of plot for each question.

Actionable Insights: Delivers clear conclusions, like "water usage is highest in summer" and "the North zone is the top consumer."

Scalable Method: The process is a clear template that can be applied to any similar time-series data (e.g., electricity, sales).
